Code repository for the research on the evodevo NKFL research project for the 2023-2024 school year [ADD RUN INSTRUCTIONS]

To find the file for configurations, click on the folder labeled "config". Then click on the folder labeled "Exaptations". Then click on the folder named "Experiments". Now click on the file named "myConfig.properties". Editing this will change parameters for experiments.
In order to replicate an experiment, change the seed to the given seed in the config file. Change the other parameters accordingly. The "state" field determines what experiment will run. All .csv files are stored in the "output" folder. The different states for the "state" field are as follows:

0: Creates a new simulation. It then runs this simulation up to the generation number given in the field "generationStoppingNumber", which it then prints to a .csv file with the title given in the field "fileName" in the .config file.

1: Creates a new simulation and runs it for the number of generations specified in the "numGenerations" field in the .config file. It then prints the best agent in each generation to a .csv file with the title given in the field "fileName" in the .config file.

7: Creates a new simulation and runs it for the number of generations specified in the "numGenerations" field in the .config file. It then prints the best agent in each generation to a .csv file with the title given in the field "fileName" in the .config file. It prints the lineage of the best agent in the last generation to the .csv with the title given in the "XXXX" field. TODO: FILL IN WHAT conditionTrack IS

10: Calculates the number h such that h is the greatest integer such that h*p, where p is the integer in the field "stepSizeNum", is less than or equal to the integer specified in the field "numGenerations". For each nonnegative integer of the form i*p where i is a nonnegative integer
less than or equal to the integer specified in the field "numGenerations", it reads the file "GenerationAtk", where k is between 0 and the integer specified in the field "numGenerations", and re-runs the simulation from that generation for the number of generations specified in "potentiationRunNum". It runs the number of trials specified in the field "constantPotentiationRunNum" for each such generation, and calculates the percentage of those
trials in which the highest possible fitness was reached. It then prints the generation number and the corresponding percentage of trials that reached the highest possible fitness to a file with the title "Potentiation.csv".

11: Creates a new simulation, runs the simulation, and gets a list of the generations generated by the simulation. Then, it writes each generation to a .csv file titled "GenerationAtk" where k is a generation number between 0 and the number given in the "numGenerations" field, inclusive.

13: This state reads in the .csv lineage file with the name given in the "lineagePotFile" field and re-instantiates each agent. It then creates the number in the field "numGenerations" generations, each generation populated with the number in the field "generationSize" clones of the agent in the lineage at that generation.

#Run Instructions
To run constant potentiation, first run state 11 and then run state 10 with the desired parameters. This is needed because state 11 generates the files which state 10 runs from. To run cloning potentiation, run state 13 and then run state 10 with the desired parameters.
